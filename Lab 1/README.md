## The Report
## Part A. Plan 

My original idea for my interactive device was a color-changing lamp. The user would be able to use a color sensor to scan an object, and the lamp would turn that color. This type of device could be used decoratively, in either a bedroom or other living space. A sketch of the storyboard for this idea is shown below.

**Summarize feedback you got here.**
Discussions in my breakout room inspired me to modify my original idea from a color-changing lamp to color changing string lights. String lights are often used for decoration in dorm rooms and bedrooms, and the color-changing feature can allow the user to match their lights to a color they enjoy. A sketch of the storyboard for the color-changing string lights is shown below.

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

**Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**

On paper it seems quite simple to "scan" an object and relay that information back to the lights. While acting out the interaction using string lights I had, I found that any sort of embedded color sensor would need to be able to communicate with every light in the string, so that the color would be uniform across all the lights. In addition, a centralized sensing system would allow the device to be less bulky. 

**Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**

One thing that my collaborators and I realized was that there needed to be some sort of mechanism that told the string lights to stop changing color (to avoid the string lights adapting to the color of the wall they are placed on). In order to address this issue, as well as implement a centralized sensor system, I decided that the color changing interation could occur when the string lights are in some sort of packaging, and when they are removed from the packaging, they will maintain their color. The user could return the string lights to the packaging in order to change the color if they so desire. 

## Part C. Prototype the device

**Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**

Using Tinkerbelle was relatively straightforward for me. I cloned the Tinkerbelle repository and installed the requirements.txt file using pip3. I was then able to run the tinker.py program using the python command, and command prompt displayed the "connected" line after I opened up httP://localhost:5000 on my desktop. I was then able to open http://192.168.1.94:5000 on my phone to control the color. Below is an image demonstrating how the color set by the desktop interface was mimicked on my phone.

## Part D. Wizard the device

**Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**

My first step here was to use the Tinkerbelle desktop to mimic the functionality of a color sensor. I put my phone next to an object with a color I wanted to imitate, and moved the color chooser until I arrived at a good match. Below is a link to the video of this attempt.

Now, change the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype. 

**Show the follow-up work here.**

## Part E. Costume the device


**Include sketches of what your device might look like here.**

Here is an image of how I costumed my device. The idea is that the string lights are in their "packaging" and can be removed to display the user's chosen light color.

**What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**

As mentioned before, it is important to have a centralized sensing system so that the string lights themselves will be less bulky, and to streamline the data delivery process. Thus, the "packaging" would contain the color sensor and microcontroller to change the color of the lights. This may be cumbersome for someone who is looking to change the color of their lights often; however, it offers a simple way to change the light color automatically without having to match it manually. 


## Part F. Record

**Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**

Below is a link to the video of a demonstration of how the user can interact with the color-changing string lights:

**Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**
The discussion in breakout rooms with Caitlin, Luca, and Jacob were helpful in polishing my original idea. Special thanks to Caitlin for helping me film my final demonstration!

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

**Summarize feedback from your partners here.**

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors, 
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

**Document everything here.**
