# Final Project

Using the tools and techniques you learned in this class, design, prototype and test an interactive device.

Functional check-off - May 10
 
Final Project Presentations (video watch party) - May 12



## Objective

The goal of this final project is for you to have a fully functioning and well-designed interactive device of your own design.
 
## Description
Your project is to design and build an interactive device to suit a specific application of your choosing. 

## Deliverables

1. Documentation of design process
> ## Motivation + Design Process
> Inspired by the game *Among Us*, we wanted to create a real-life task simulator. Originally, we wanted to do a full recreation of *Among Us*, complete with multiplayer functionality and imposters, but with the time and hardware available to us, we decided to focus on the crewmate task portion of the game. At this point, we went through all the tasks in the game and brainstormed how each of them could be implemented with our available hardware components. Then, with our time constraint in mind, we chose our favorites to be implemented, which we will elaborate on more in the following sections.

> ## High-Level Task Overview
> ### Wires
> In this task, wires are connected in a color-defined configuration in order to light up the respective LEDs. This is inspired by the “Fix Wiring” task in *Among Us*, which is essentially the same thing.
> ### Card Swipe
> In this task, the player “swipes” along a capacitive touch sensor for a certain amount of time to mimic the “Swipe Card” task. SImilar to the original task, if the user swipes too quickly or too slowly, they will need to repeat the task.
> ### Keypad Pattern
> Inspired by the “Start Reactor” task, this consists of several buttons that will blink in a pattern that the player mimics. The pattern appends in length at each stage until they reach the final pattern.
> ### Honorable Mentions
> Here are more tasks that we had come up with during our brainstorming process. While these would have been fun to include, we kept our time constraint in mind, and also noted that these tasks were not as similar to the original tasks as the ones we ultimately chose. 
#### Engine Alignment 
> The user would move the potentiometer until it reached a certain measurement. Inspired by the “Align Engine Output” task, which requires the player to line up a dial with a line on the screen.
#### Clear out the Dumpster
> In this task, which is inspired by ”Empty Garbage”, the player would hold down the joystick (acting as the trash shoot lever), for a number of seconds.
####“Medical” Scan
> inspired by the “Submit Scan” task, would consist of the game asking the player to hold up a certain amount of fingers, and using the camera to scan and check if the correct number of fingers are held up. This is not very similar to the original task, which requires no interaction from the player.

 
2. Archive of all code, design patterns, etc. used in the final design. (As with labs, the standard should be that the documentation would allow you to recreate your project if you woke up with amnesia.)
3. Video of someone using your project (or as safe a version of that as can be managed given social distancing)
4. Reflections on process (What have you learned or wish you knew at the start?)



## Teams

You can and are not required to work in teams. Be clear in documentation who contributed what. The total project contributions should reflect the number of people on the project.

## Examples

[Here is a list of good final projects from previous classes.](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/wiki/Previous-Final-Projects)
This version of the class is very different, but it may be useful to see these.
